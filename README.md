# ML-Classification-Algorithm:
Creating an algorithm to classify the flowers where we have flowers from 3 classes and being a small dataset it has 50 samples 
from each class.
Many algorithms  (a mixture of Linear and non-Linear )were tried to find the best suitable algorithm depending on the accuracy of the 
algorithm on the training data and 10-fold cross validation was used to predict the skill of the algorithm on the new unpredicted 
data.

Data Pre-processing:<br>
Many graphs like histogram and box plots were plotted to interpret the data and possibly to get basic idea about the distriibution
of data and Scatter plot was also used to see the correlation of the data and see which algorithm could possibly be used to 
model the data.<br>
Attribute to be predicted : Class of the flower.

Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:<br>
-- Iris Setosa<br>
-- Iris Versicolour<br>
-- Iris Virginica<br>
